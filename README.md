- Predicting cell phone sales is crucial for companies in the telecommunications industry to optimize inventory management, marketing strategies, and revenue forecasting.
- In this project, a particular use case is taken with all different mobile specifications to help a buisness owner to gain a competitive leverage over other businesses in the market.
- A predictive model that forecasts future cell phone prices with accuracy is built using all the relevant data.

**2. Texas Salary Prediction**

- Understanding salary trends and predicting future earnings is valuable for both job seekers and employers. 
- This project is all about analyzing salary data from various industries and professions in Texas to build a predictive model that estimates salaries based on job attributes such as experience, education, skillset etc.,

**3. Earthquake Damage Prediction**

- Earthquakes can cause devastating damage to infrastructure, leading to loss of lives and economic setbacks.
- Predicting the potential damage caused by earthquakes is essential for disaster preparedness and response planning.
- Hence here seismic data, geographical features, and building characteristics of 2015 earthquake disaster in Nepal are utilized to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the severity of earthquake damage.
