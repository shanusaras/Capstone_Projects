### ML Capstone Projects
  In this repository, there are three exciting projects that demonstrate the power and versatility of machine learning in solving real-world problems. Each project focuses on a different domain, offering a unique challenge and opportunity to explore various machine learning techniques.

#### GENERAL OVERVIEW

**1. Cell Phones Price Prediction**

- Predicting cell phone sales is crucial for companies in the telecommunications industry to optimize inventory management, marketing strategies, and revenue forecasting.
- In this project, a particular use case is taken with all different mobile specifications to help a buisness owner to gain a competitive leverage over other businesses in the market.
- A predictive model that forecasts future cell phone prices with accuracy is built using all the relevant data.

**2. Texas Salary Prediction**

- Understanding salary trends and predicting future earnings is valuable for both job seekers and employers. 
- This project is all about analyzing salary data from various industries and professions in Texas to build a predictive model that estimates salaries based on job attributes such as experience, education, skillset etc.,

**3. Earthquake Damage Prediction**

- Earthquakes can cause devastating damage to infrastructure, leading to loss of lives and economic setbacks.
- Predicting the potential damage caused by earthquakes is essential for disaster preparedness and response planning. Hence here, utilize seismic data, geographical features, and building characteristics of 2015 earthquake disaster in Nepal to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the severity of earthquake damage.
